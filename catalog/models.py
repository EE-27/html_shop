Task 2 Create a new blog post model with the following fields:

title, 
slug (implement via CharField), 
content, preview (image), 
creation date, 
publication sign, 
number of views. 

Implement a CRUD for the new model to work with the blog.
--Slug - a human-understandable URL, is a set of characters that can be read as coherent words or 
--sentences in the address bar, serves as a unique record identifier within a single model and consists 
--of characters that are safe for query processing:

0-9 ,
a-z (usually lower case), 
character - .

Task 3 Modify the output and query processing by adding the following logic at the controller level:

when opening an individual article, 
increase the view counter; 
display in the list of articles only those that have a positive publication sign; 
when creating, dynamically generate a slug name for the title; 
after successfully editing an entry, redirect the user to view that article. 

* Additional task When an article reaches 100 views, send yourself an email 
congratulating yourself on the achievement.

Note: we recommend using the Yandex mail service to send emails.
